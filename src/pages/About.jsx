          Enter the world's first Invisible Cloud
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Welcome to <span className="font-semibold text-black">OneCloudStorage</span> — where we introduce <strong>world's first Invisible Cloud</strong> with Zero Knowledge Data storage architecture, powered by our <strong>Distributed, Virtual Storage Cloud</strong> (<em>US Patent 9128626</em>). 
          <br /><br />
          We’re revolutionizing cloud storage by rationalizing how assurance is delivered—ensuring defense against ransomware attacks, and future-proofing against quantum threats. Our information-theoretic security ensures that your data is not just protected from today’s threats—but is mathematically secured, forever.
          <br /><br />
          Unlike conventional storage, our system fragments and disperses unintelligible data shards across multiple clouds in a patented <strong>RAID-across-Clouds</strong> structure. This means your data is safe—even if a provider is compromised—without relying on computational security or blind trust.
          <br /><br />
          With our groundbreaking stack, attacks using quantum computing on cryptographic keys become obsolete. We’ve <em>squared the circle</em>—delivering true data privacy, supported by a growing suite of granted and pending <strong>US patents</strong>.
